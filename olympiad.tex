\item Equilateral triangles $ABK$, $BCL$, $CDM$, $DAN$ are constructed inside the square $ABCD$. Prove that the midpoints of the four segments $KL$, $LM$, $MN$, $NK$ and the midpoints of the eight segments $AKBK$, $BL$, $CL$, $CM$, $DM$, $DN$, $AN$ are the twelve vertices of a regular dodecagon.

\item In a finite sequence of real numbers the sum of any seven successive terms is negative, and the sum of any eleven successive terms is positive. Determine the maximum number of terms in the sequence.
\item 	Let $n$ be a given integer \textgreater $2$, and let $V_{n}$ be the set of integers $1+ kn$, where $k = 1, 2 ,\ldots A$ number $m \epsilon V_{n}$ is called indecomposable in $V_{n}$, if there do not exist numbers $p$ ,$q \epsilon V_{n}$ such that $pq = m$. Prove that there exists a number $r \epsilon V_{n}$ that can be expressed as the product of elements indecomposable in $V_{n}$ in more than one way. (products which differ only in the order of their factors will be considered the same).
\item Four real constants $a, b, A, B$ are given, and \begin{align}

\item Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. When $a^2 + b^2$ is divided by $a+b$, the quotient is $q$ and the remainder is $r$. Find all pairs \brak{a, b} such that $q^2 + r = 1977.$ 
\item	Let $f\brak{n}$ be a function defined on the set of all positive integers and having all its values in the same set. Prove that if \begin{align}f\brak{n + 1} \textgreater f\brak{f\brak{n}}\end{align} for each positive integer $n$, then \begin{align}f\brak{n} = n\end{align} for each $n$

\item $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers with $1 \leq m \textless n$ In their decimal representations, the last three digits of $1978$ are equal, respectively, to the last three digits of $1978$". Find $m$ and $n$ such that $m+n$ has its least value.
\item $P$ is a given point inside a given sphere. Three mutually perpendic ular rays from Pintersect the sphere at points $U, V$, and $W$; $Q$ denotes the vertex diagonally opposite to $P$ in the parallelepiped determined by $PU, PV$, and $PW$.

\item An international society has its members from six different countries. The list of members contains $1978$ names, numbered $1, 2,\ldots$, $1978$. Prove that there is at least one member whose number is the sum of the numbers of two members from his own country, or twice as large as the number of one member from his own country.

\item Let $p$ and $q$ be natural numbers such that \begin{align}\frac{p}{q}=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\ldots -\frac{1}{1318}+\frac{1}{1319}\end{align}.Prove that $p$ is divisible by $1979$.

Show that all $10$ sides of the top and bottom faces are the same color.
\item Two circles in a plane intersect. Let $A$ be one of the points of intersection. Starting simultaneously from $A$ two points move with constant speeds, each point travelling along its own circle in the same sense. The two points return to $A$ simultaneously after one revolution. Prove that there is a fixed point $P$ in the plane such that, at any time, the distances from $P$ to the moving points are equal.

	\item Let $A$ and $E$ be opposite vertices of a regular octagon. $A$ frog starts jumping at vertex $A$. From any vertex of the octagon except $E$, it may jump to either of the two adjacent vertices.
